# ng.componenteditor — Change Log

This document tracks changes made to the `ng.componenteditor` plugin since its initial creation from the WOLips source.

## Origin

`ng.componenteditor` is a standalone Eclipse plugin extracted from the WOLips plugin suite. It merges source from ~18 WOLips plugins into a single bundle, with unique identifiers (`ng.componenteditor.*`) so it can coexist with a WOLips installation.

The initial import was commit `d2c9da47` ("Initial ng import").

## Changes

### Plugin infrastructure

- **New activator:** Bundle activator is `tk.eclipse.plugin.htmleditor.HTMLPlugin` (declared in MANIFEST.MF). Old per-plugin activators were converted to plain singletons.
- **Removed `CorePlugin.PLUGIN_ID`:** The constant `"org.objectstyle.wolips.core"` was unused and potentially confusing — removed.
- **Unique extension IDs:** All `plugin.xml` extension IDs use `ng.componenteditor.*` prefix instead of `org.objectstyle.wolips.*`.

### Features / Fixes

- **Single-file template support:** Added support for `.html` templates that are not inside `.wo` bundles.
- **Tag autocomplete and attribute name autocomplete** in the template editor.
- **Component ↔ Java switching** now works correctly.
- **Binding validation:** Template/WOD validation with markers working. Fixed marker type to use the `ng.componenteditor` bundle symbolic name.
- **CMD-click "Create key/action" dialog:** Fixed — CMD-clicking an unresolved binding keypath now correctly opens the "Add Key" or "Add Action" dialog. The old code required `isValid()` which returned `false` for ng-objects types (they don't implement `NSKeyValueCoding`). The check was relaxed to only require `!exists() && isSingleKey()`.
- **`NGContext` class name fix** for ng-objects compatibility.

### Removed: EOF / EOModeler

All EOModeler/EOF-related code was removed (~130 files). This includes:

- `org.objectstyle.wolips.eomodeler.core` — entire package (model classes, KVC framework, utils, etc.)
- EOModel resource adapters and related factory registrations

ng-objects does not use EOF.

### Removed: Build infrastructure / Patternsets

Patternsets are WO-specific build configuration for include/exclude patterns on resources, classes, and webserver resources. Removed entirely:

- `org.objectstyle.wolips.editors.patterset` — PatternsetEditor, PatternsetPage, PatternsetEditorMessages
- `org.objectstyle.wolips.core.resources.pattern` — PatternsetMatcher, PatternsetReader, PatternsetWriter, IPatternList, PatternList
- `org.objectstyle.wolips.core.resources.internal.types.project.ProjectPatternsets`
- `plugin.xml` — patternset content type and editor registrations

Cascading from patternset removal, the entire WOLips builder infrastructure was also removed (all unreferenced by the component editor):

- `org.objectstyle.wolips.core.resources.internal.build` — Builder, BuilderWrapper, AbstractBuildVisitor, IncrementalBuildDeltaVisitor, FullBuildDeltaVisitor
- `CorePlugin` — removed `BuilderWrapper` field and `loadBuilderExtensionPoint()`/`getBuilderWrapper()` methods

### Removed: Plist editors

Two self-contained plist editor packages were removed (22 files total):

- `org.objectstyle.wolips.wooeditor.plisteditor` — text-based plist source editor with syntax coloring (PlistEditor, PlistConfiguration, PlistDocumentProvider, PlistScanner, etc.)
- `org.objectstyle.wolips.baseforuiplugins.plist` — tree-based plist editor widget (PropertyListEditor, PropertyListEditorPart, content/label providers, editing support classes, StableDataStructureFactory, etc.)

Neither package was referenced by any other code in the plugin.

### Removed: PB.project / legacy project types

- `PBDotProjectAdapter` — legacy PB.project file support
- `DotSubprojAdapter` — subproject folder adapter
- `FileAdapterFactory` — file-level adapter factory
- `AbstractResourceAdapter`, `LocalizedPath`, `ILocalizedPath`
- `IPBDotProjectOwner`, `IPBDotProjectAdapter`, `IDotSubprojAdapter`

### Removed: Other unused code

- `WOLipsNatureUtils` — WOLips nature checking utilities
- `IWOLipsResource`, `ComponentWOLipsResource`, `EOModelWOLipsResource`, `GenericWOLipsResource` — WOLips resource type hierarchy
- `WOLipsResourceAdapterFactory`
- `DotLprojAdapter`, `IDotLprojAdapter` — localized project folder adapters
- `DotEOModeldAdapter`, `IDotEOModeldAdapter` — .eomodeld folder adapters
- `WoprojectAdapter`, `IWoprojectAdapter` — .woproj folder adapters
- `IProjectPatternsets` — interface for project patternsets
- `SubTypeHierarchyCache`, `SuperTypeHierarchyCache` — type hierarchy caches
- `ILaunchInfo` — launch configuration interface
- `Preferences` — stripped down significantly (removed unused launch/build preference code)
- `IResourceType` — unused marker interface
- `ProjectAdapter` — stripped down significantly (removed dead methods referencing deleted adapters)
- `FolderAdapterFactory` — stripped down (removed registrations for deleted adapters)
- `ProjectVariables` — stripped down drastically. Dropped `IPersistentPreferenceStore` interface, removed all path getters, listener support, numeric getters/setters, save/dirty tracking. Only `getString()`, `getString(name, default)`, and `getBoolean(name, default)` are actually used.
- `ERXValueUtilities` — deleted entirely. Was an ERExtensions utility class (~740 lines). Boolean parsing logic inlined into `ProjectVariables.getBoolean()`. The `er.extensions.foundation` package is gone.
